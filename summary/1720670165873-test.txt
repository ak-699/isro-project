Here is a summary of the transcript:

The recording system has certain options:

* You can pause or stop the recording at any time.
* However, once started, you cannot cancel the recording mid-process.
* If you try to leave the recording without saving it, you will be prompted with a notification asking if you're sure you want to abandon the recording (which would result in loss of data).
* You have the option to stop the recording now.
