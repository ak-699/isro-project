0	9280	So, this is my update for the project.
9280	11600	I have improved the record audio functionality.
11600	21400	As you can see, we can start recording and there is an option to stop it and pause it.
21400	22900	You cannot cancel it in between.
22900	27440	It will show you a notification, you have unsaved notification, unsaved recording, are
27440	29880	you sure you want to leave, your recording will be lost.
29880	35600	We will press cancel, recording will start from as usual, we can stop the recording now.
35600	40880	Again, without a update, uploading, if we cancel it, we will again get a notification
40880	46600	that do you want to save the recording, we press cancel, we can even refresh it and we
46600	51880	will get another problem, changes that you may not be saved, you just cancel.
51880	52880	Here we can upload it.
52880	56880	Once we upload it, we will redirect it to the audio analysis page.
56880	59640	Here we can preview our recording.
59640	65360	If we press transcribe, here you can see without transcription, summarization is disabled,
65360	69240	we will press transcribe, we will get a banner, transcription started and a skeleton loading
69240	70240	effect.
70240	77560	After some time, transition will be done and this is transcript and it is now enabled,
77560	78560	summarization.
78560	83080	So, we will press summarization now, summarization has started, as you can see the skeleton
83080	88960	loading effect, here summarization is done, we will click cancel, this is the summary.
88960	95200	Now we will go back to the dashboard, we can see our recording has been added, if we click
95200	103720	on it, we will go to the audio analysis page, let's go back again and let's try to close
103720	104720	the server once.
104720	117120	So, here we will close the server and we will refresh it, we have got the error occurred
117120	121840	while fetching files, we refresh after some time, we have got a no file, so here we have
121840	127720	got feedback that we have files, but due to some error, we cannot see them correctly,
127720	130640	we will just close it and that's it.
