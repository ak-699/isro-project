00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
So, this is my update for the project.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.600
I have improved the record audio functionality.

00:11.600 --> 00:21.400
As you can see, we can start recording and there is an option to stop it and pause it.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.900
You cannot cancel it in between.

00:22.900 --> 00:27.440
It will show you a notification, you have unsaved notification, unsaved recording, are

00:27.440 --> 00:29.880
you sure you want to leave, your recording will be lost.

00:29.880 --> 00:35.600
We will press cancel, recording will start from as usual, we can stop the recording now.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.880
Again, without a update, uploading, if we cancel it, we will again get a notification

00:40.880 --> 00:46.600
that do you want to save the recording, we press cancel, we can even refresh it and we

00:46.600 --> 00:51.880
will get another problem, changes that you may not be saved, you just cancel.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
Here we can upload it.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.880
Once we upload it, we will redirect it to the audio analysis page.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.640
Here we can preview our recording.

00:59.640 --> 01:05.360
If we press transcribe, here you can see without transcription, summarization is disabled,

01:05.360 --> 01:09.240
we will press transcribe, we will get a banner, transcription started and a skeleton loading

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
effect.

01:10.240 --> 01:17.560
After some time, transition will be done and this is transcript and it is now enabled,

01:17.560 --> 01:18.560
summarization.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.080
So, we will press summarization now, summarization has started, as you can see the skeleton

01:23.080 --> 01:28.960
loading effect, here summarization is done, we will click cancel, this is the summary.

01:28.960 --> 01:35.200
Now we will go back to the dashboard, we can see our recording has been added, if we click

01:35.200 --> 01:43.720
on it, we will go to the audio analysis page, let's go back again and let's try to close

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
the server once.

01:44.720 --> 01:57.120
So, here we will close the server and we will refresh it, we have got the error occurred

01:57.120 --> 02:01.840
while fetching files, we refresh after some time, we have got a no file, so here we have

02:01.840 --> 02:07.720
got feedback that we have files, but due to some error, we cannot see them correctly,

02:07.720 --> 02:10.640
we will just close it and that's it.
